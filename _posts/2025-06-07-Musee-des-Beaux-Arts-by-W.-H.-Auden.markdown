## Musee des Beaux Arts

*by W. H. Auden*

About suffering they were never wrong,<br>
The Old Masters; how well, they understood<br>
Its human position; how it takes place<br>
While someone else is eating or opening a window or just walking dully along;<br>
Howï¼Œwhen the aged are reverently, passionately waiting<br>
For the miraculous birth, there always must be<br>
Children who did not specially want it to happen, skating<br>
On a pond at theedge of the wood:<br>
They never forgot<br>
That even the dreadful martyrdom must run its course<br>
Anyhow in a corner, some untidy spot<br>
Where the dogs go on with their doggy life and the torturer's horse<br>
Scratches its innocent behind on a tree.<br>

In Breughel's Icarus, for instance: how everything turns away<br>
Quite leisurely from the disaster; the ploughman may<br>
Have heard the splash, the forsaken cry,<br>
But for him it was not an important failure; the sun shone<br>
As it had to on the white legs disappearing into the green<br>
Water; and the expensive delicate ship that must have seen<br>
Something amazing, a boy falling out of the sky,<br>
had somewhere to get to and sailed calmly on.

*I took the College Entrance Exam on this day last year. Months before that spot, I encountered this poem and shared it with some others.*

*There's a line: "You're never really done for as long as you've got a good story and someone to tell it to." This poem has undoubtedly inspired several  good conversations and brought about some nice stories. And later on, those conversations themselves naturally became new stories. This is how time exists and folds.*
