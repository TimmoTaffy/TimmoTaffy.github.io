## Musee des Beaux Arts

*by W. H. Auden*

About suffering they were never wrong,<br>
The Old Masters; how well, they understood<br>
Its human position; how it takes place<br>
While someone else is eating or opening a window or just walking dully along;<br>
How, when the aged are reverently, passionately waiting<br>
For the miraculous birth, there always must be<br>
Children who did not specially want it to happen, skating<br>
On a pond at theedge of the wood:<br>
They never forgot<br>
That even the dreadful martyrdom must run its course<br>
Anyhow in a corner, some untidy spot<br>
Where the dogs go on with their doggy life and the torturer's horse<br>
Scratches its innocent behind on a tree.<br>

In Breughel's Icarus, for instance: how everything turns away<br>
Quite leisurely from the disaster; the ploughman may<br>
Have heard the splash, the forsaken cry,<br>
But for him it was not an important failure; the sun shone<br>
As it had to on the white legs disappearing into the green<br>
Water; and the expensive delicate ship that must have seen<br>
Something amazing, a boy falling out of the sky,<br>
had somewhere to get to and sailed calmly on.

*I took the College Entrance Exam on this day last year. Months before that spot, I encountered this poem and shared it with some others.*

*There's a line: "You're never really done for as long as you've got a good story and someone to tell it to." This poem has undoubtedly inspired several great conversations and brought about some good stories. Later, those conversations themselves naturally became new stories. This is how time exists and folds.*

And following is some quotes from Yale's open course ENGL-310 Modern Poetry, taught by Langdon Hammer in Spring 2007, which offers some interesting insights to the poem, and the pictures involved.

*He is, however, thinking, I suppose, about romanticism in general and its ambitions. Here, the sun shines as it had to. What it illuminates are white legs. There's a kind of objectivity in that, there's a kind of naturalism. It shines on green water. It's as if from a certain perspective, from the perspective of aesthetic form, these elements of the picture are merely elements of the picture – colors, which have meaning as they are placed in a system of relationships and a system of perspectives.*

*Well, there's a great deal more to be said about this painting. I think one idea that is worth emphasizing is the way in which the ploughman, in Auden's account as in Brueghel's painting, has prominence, has a greater prominence than the heroic, romantic figure plunging into the sea. The ploughman is going about his ordinary daily work, and as he turns these furrows, we are reminded, as Auden surely was reminded, of the ancient classical connection between verse – meaning the turning, in Latin, from one line to another – and the shaping action of the plough that creates these furrows in the earth, committing the poet, as he identifies with the ploughman, to a kind of poetry of craft and of the earth that involves, in a sense, turning away from disaster.*
  
But *It* matters, no?
