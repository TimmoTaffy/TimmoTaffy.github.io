Not that rainy,
Not that Nighthawk,
Just Subway.

I entered the store at approximately 20:10, after drifting along the streets in the rain for half an hour. No one in sight. Rifrigerator fan humming steadily. Light green wall paper. Light yellow couches. Bright LED lights. My takeaway package is on the cashier counter. No one in sight. 

"Press 'F' to Interact"  
"Press 'G' to Leave"

Yet I quickly decided to eat my sandwich in the store, on the light yellow couch, facing the light green wall paper. No one in sight.

Quite Subway.  
A little bit Nighthawk, but not that Nighthawk.

Ten minutes passed and a worker suddenly appeared behind the cashier.

...

One person in sight.  
Quite Nighthawk now.

No, still not that Nighthawk. Not that Subway either, actually.  
I've got somewhere to return to. Maybe not exactly the case for the Nighthawks.

*P.S. I've been expecting the **Nighthawks** to be larger, which is, in fact, to my surprise and somehow interestingly, not the case.*
