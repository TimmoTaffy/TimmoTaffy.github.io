On MBTI I am not quite at ease, those questions<br>
keep me thinking of their implications,<br>
and the implications<br>
of me thinking about their implications.<br>
Among the five options, thus<br>
I take the fifth.<br>
  
Yet there are people who have faith<br>
in the questions, and their types would often quietly follow their names.<br>
So maybe there is a gentler way that brings about more construction:<br>
to see it less as a portrait of who you are,<br>
but a pronouncement, a declaration<br>
of self-perception,<br>
about how you hope to be known.<br>
