On MBTI I am not quite at ease, those questions  
keep me thinking of their implications,  
and the implications  
of me thinking about their implications.  
Among the five options, thus  
I take the fifth.  
  
Yet there are people who have faith  
in the questions, and their types would often quietly follow their names.  
Perhaps there is a gentler way that brings about more construction:  
to see it less as a portrait of who you are,  
but a pronouncement, a declaration  
of self-perception,  
about how you hope to be known.
